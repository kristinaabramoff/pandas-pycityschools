## Pandas Challenge

This code was written using Python with the pandas library. It merges two CSV files combining information from two separate datasets, joining them together to enable a comprehensive examination of various factors influencing school performance in reading and maths across 15 different schools categorized by school type (government or independent), school size, and school budget per student per year.

my code is found in the PyCitySchools subfolder and the file is called "PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb"

The written analysis is found on the bottom of the code and as well as a word document found in the main folder "Pandas_challenge"
